Hi Dr Chin! 

This code is my attempt on building an AI chess app.
The main premise of this game is to build a ChessTutoring App where users can go
head to head with an advanced AI bot that is not too skilled nor too new to the game of chess.

The AI is to be--as the user selects-- 50, 100, or 200 elo above the current player elo score point.
Moreover, the player has access to past games to have a skim through what they did and study it.

The 4 main functions of this app are the following:
1. The user can move a peice
2. The user can take an opponent piece
3. The user can skim through the move history of both the current and past played games
4. The user can select the game structure
   5. AI difficulty
   6. Player roles
   7. Time allocated
